### Hi, I'm Stephen 👋

Throughout my career, I have developed a strong skill set in software development, cybersecurity, site reliability engineering, and machine learning, having successfully addressed business challenges across various stages of the product development lifecycle. As an avid learner, I stay adaptable to the ever-evolving technology landscape, and I am passionate about the innovation and opportunities the tech industry offers. I have had the privilege of working for such companies as Equinix, Global Payments, and Georgia Tech Research Institute.  

Whether I'm writing code in Go, scripting in Python, configuring CI/CD workflows, or developing Kubernetes manifests, I focus on ensuring clarity, correctness, and efficiency to optimize product maintenance. I follow Kent Beck’s design principles, which emphasize: 1) Passing tests, 2) Revealing intention, 3) Avoiding duplication, and 4) Using the fewest elements. Having worked on numerous legacy systems, I am particularly mindful of the importance of future-proofing solutions with an eye toward maintaining code quality and professional courtesy for future developers.

Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and recreational sports. Indoors, I spend my time reading, experimenting with bread baking, and exploring various tech interests, including Arduino microcontrollers, security-focused Android distributions (such as LineageOS and CalyxOS), SELinux, container security, and diving into the world of 3D printing.
